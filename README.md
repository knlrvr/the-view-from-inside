## Description
The View From Inside is an exceptionally performant blog powered by Sanity's dynamic capabilities. It seamlessly handles content creation with native editing, while its dynamic routing supports individual post pages for effortless article exploration. With optimized loading times and responsiveness through static generation, The View From Inside delivers compelling content in a user-friendly and efficient manner.

## Purpose
TVFI was built for a client that no longer wished to use a drag-and-drop website editor. With the capabilities of both Next & Sanity, the experience for both the client and the client's audience has improved drastically.
