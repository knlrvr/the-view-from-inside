## Description
The View From Inside (TVFI) is a statically generated blog with dynamic routes to support each blog post. It supports easy  content editing via Sanity Studio with side-by-side content previews, so the author knows exactly what they're publishing. 

<a name="purpose"></a>
## Purpose
TVFI was built for a client that no longer wished to use a drag-and-drop website editor. With the capabilities of both Next & Sanity, the experience for both the client and the client's audience has improved drastically.
